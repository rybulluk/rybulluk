# About me

- 🔭 **I work for a large airline as ground staff. I seek something more fulfilling (and better paid)** 👺
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Webflow and, of course, the Git Universe in my spare time. 
      I know I have the capacity to learn tech as I passed a Salesforce Associate credential before life took me elsewhere.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate in any way necessary to successfully career pivot post-pandemic and post-50!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help choosing an appropriate path to greatness (again)
- 💬 Worked in the Health & Fitness industry for 17 years, 7 years of which I was Sole Director of a Gym in Central London ❤
- 📫 How to reach me: **shout out my name 3 times**
- 😄 Pronouns: *He, Him, Ha!* 😛
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I am a great dancer for a middle aged white man**.
